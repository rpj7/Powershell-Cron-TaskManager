# Powershell-Cron-TaskManager
Created to implement a cron version of task scheduler as Company Group policy restricts TaskScheduler from running jobs with user credentials if not logged on.
Then just edit the schedule.txt with the crontab, executable and working path and run.
Manager can be set to run as a service with NSSM.
